# Chatbot-using-langchain-with-gemini
An intelligent and responsive AI chatbot built using LangChain, powered by Google Gemini 1.5 Flash, and served via a sleek Flask web interface. This project demonstrates how to maintain full conversation context, label messages clearly (System / Human / AI), and deliver dynamic, natural interactions in a lightweight Python environment.
